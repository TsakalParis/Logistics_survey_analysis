Survey about the use of Total Quality Managment for companies in the logistics sector

This is a project where i did the statistical analysis for a clients thesis in Public managment and business administration. The survey was created by the client and was 
sent to people who work in the logistics sector. The data was translated into english by me. Part of the content is what the client requested. The survey was conducted 
using google forms, so my job was to provide additional information, rather than just have the standard insights that google provides by default.
The base of this case study is to see the degree of which total quality managment is used in the logistics sector. 

This analysis contains the following steps not in order:
-Process dataframe
-Generalize dataframe
-Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient
-Finding Correlations
-Function to calculate p-value from pearson correlation table
-Function that filters values in dataframe based on condition
-Checking correlations statistical importance using p-value
-Displaying the important correlations
-Confidence Interval for Correlation
--- Step 1: Create functions
--- Step 2: Pass desired values

-Confidence Interval for Mean
-Median and Mode
-Skewness
-IQR
-Kurtosis
-Data Visualization
---Histogram
---Box Plot
---Violin Plot
